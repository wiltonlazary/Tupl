/**
 * Used internally by Locker. Only detects deadlocks caused by independent
 * threads. A thread "self deadlock" caused by separate lockers in the same
 * thread is not detected. This is because there is only one thread blocked.
 * The detector relies on multiple threads to be blocked waiting on a lock.
 * Lockers aren't registered with any specific thread, and therefore locks
 * cannot be owned by threads. If this policy changes, then the detector could
 * see that the thread is self deadlocked.
